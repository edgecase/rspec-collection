# rspec-collection

Allow RSpec assertions over the elements of a collection.

## Usage

Allow RSpec assertions over the elements of a collection.  For example:

    collection.should all\_be > 0

will specify that each element of the collection should be greater
than zero.  Each element of the collection that fails the test will
be reported in the error message.

Examples:

    [1,1,1].should all\_be eq(1)
    [2,4,6].should all\_be\_even
    [3,6,9].should all\_be\_divisible_by(3)
    [1,1,1].should all\_be == 1
    [2,3,5].should all\_be { |n| prime?(n) }

(for appropriate definitions of prime? and divisible_by?)
